# Parallel Machine Learning

__Parallelising Training of a Convolutional Neural Network Model for Image Classification__

As machine learning typically demands high amounts of computation, they are perfect candidates for parallel programming. We focus on the domain of Image Classification with the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We have implemented sequential implementations, attempted multicore parallelism, and implemented a distributed solution to achieve data parallelism using Python, Tensorflow, and the Google Cloud Platform. These implementations train a CNN for Image Classification.
